    <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">ABOUT NODE.JS?</h1>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open source server environment
        Node.js is free
        Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
        Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

    </p>
    <h2 style="color: coral;">Why Node.js?</h2>
    <p>A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

        Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
        
            Sends the task to the computer's file system.
            Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
            Returns the content to the client.
            Ready to handle the next request.

            Ready to handle the next request.
            When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
        
        Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
        
        Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.

    <h2 style="color: cyan;">What Can Node.js Do?</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js can generate dynamic page content
        Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
        Node.js can collect form data
        Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkmagenta;">What is a Node.js File?</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
        A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
        Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
        Node.js files have extension ".js"
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">What is a Module in Node.js?</h2>
    <p>

        Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
        
        A set of functions you want to include in your application.
        Built-in Modules
        
        Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
        
        Look at our Built-in Modules Reference for a complete list of modules.
        Include Modules
        
        To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:</p>
